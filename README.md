The Falcon data acquisition system is provided by the following subsystems:

The main functions of the Falcon data acquisition system are:
1. Store the signals acquired by the fast data acquisiton system in an MDSplus database;
2. Store the signals acquired by the control system in an MDSplus database;
  1. Some of the signals are continuosly stored (everytime the signal changes);
